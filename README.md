#javelin-bp
Boilerplate build process for starting a new site in Javelin CMS.

###Tasks
There are more tasks at work during the build process, but these three should be the only ones you need to work with.

```
gulp build        Start the build process.
gulp clean        Remove build files completely. This automatically happens when using the build task.
gulp help         Display a listing of all tasks contained in gulpfile.js.
```

###Additional Files
Located within the `./ai` directory are several Adobe Illustrator files and `.svg` files that come packaged with newly generated site templates. These are just placeholders and are meant to be replaced. The `.ai` files are also placeholders and are meant to be edited and saved over.
